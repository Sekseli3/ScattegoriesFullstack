# Scattegories Online
Popular board game scattegories turned to a Website.
Right now the game is single player. The aim of the game is to come up with words that fit a category and start with the rolled letter.
You have 60 seconds to fill the categories marked with sound(Ticking clock), after that time runs out(explosion)
You can roll a new letter and start a new round with new categories
