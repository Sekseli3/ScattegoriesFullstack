# Scattegories Online
Popular board game scattegories turned to a Website.
Right now the game is single player.

## Front End
Front end done with React + Vite. I used Reacts router to navigate through addresses.

## How to play
Tutorial found in /tutorial. The aim of the game is to come up with words that fit a category and start with the rolled letter.
You have 60 seconds to fill the categories marked with sound(Ticking clock), after that time runs out(explosion)
You can roll a new letter and start a new round with new categories.

## Start Screen:
Has 3 buttons: Start, Roll and Restart. Roll assigns you a letter, Restart returns you to Start screen and is pressable any time. Start button starts the game. It won't let you start if you haven't rolled a letter.
